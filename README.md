# TYB
Fragments of mockup web design (and possibly code) for the TagYourBooks project. Probably useless to everyone else.

Note: There is at least one vector image file here, in SVG format. I have uploaded the original Intaglio document (which is a “package”, meaning a directory which the Mac GUI treats as though it were a file, and therefore had to be converted into a .zip archive), and also the Intaglio document exported to Encapsulated PostScript, which is certainly openable in Adobe Illustrator and is probably openable in other programs as well, but may or may not retain all the Intaglio data. (I don't know, I've never bothered to check.)
